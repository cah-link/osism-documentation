Notes
=====

The notes are a collection of things that do not fit well into
the other sections and chapters. Anything can be added here that
has been found useful in an OSISM environment.

Especially some obscure error messages for which you had to search
for a long time and which was not easy to find.

Any hints that might save another operator's day are right here.
