* Avoid duplications and redundancies

  * When you commit to the ``testbed`` repository it is not necessary to use a prefix ``testbed:`` (e.g.
    ``Remove all easter eggs`` instead of ``testbed: remove all easter eggs``

  * When you commit to the ``testbed`` repository, it is not necessary to say that you are committing
    to the testbed repository (e.g. ``Remove all easter eggs`` instead of ``Remove all easter eggs in
    the testbed repository``)
